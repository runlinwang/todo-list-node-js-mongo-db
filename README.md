# RunLin's To Do App Using Node.JS and MongoDB

## To do app is deployed at https://vast-falls-13323.herokuapp.com/

This project was built following the tutorial at https://medium.com/@diogo.fg.pinheiro/simple-to-do-list-app-with-node-js-and-mongodb-chapter-2-3780a1c5b039

The deployment process to Heroku was done following the instructions at https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-nodejs

## Instructions:

The easiest way to access my web app is by visiting the url at https://vast-falls-13323.herokuapp.com/

Alternately, you can download the files in this folder locally. In order to run the web app locally, navigate to the main directory containing all these files in Terminal, make sure the 3000 address is not already in use by something else, and execute "npm start" on the command line. Once you see the line "Server up and running" printed, you can visit the site at http://localhost:3000/ to see the same app.

## Reflections:

Node.js offers more flexibility in how to display HTML by letting the Javascript code run on the server-side, outside of the browser. Meanwhile, vanilla JS only allows the script to be run in the browser on the user side. As such, Javascript is better suited for front-end development while Node.js can be used for server-side development. 

The integration of MongoDB allows users to store modified website data on the cloud, enabling them (and potentially other users) to access this data from other machines by making a connection to the cloud database. Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS have no method of storing data on the cloud without external integrations, and can at most store files locally. MongoDB thus allows website developers to easily collect and analyze data centrally, while also facilitating ease of use on the user side if they need to access modified website data across different machines.
